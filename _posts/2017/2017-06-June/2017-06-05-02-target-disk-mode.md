If your Mac has a firmware password and you want to boot into Target Disk Mode you can’t just hold down `T` while the computer boots. It won’t prompt for a password or anything. To get around this I’ve been booting into systems, removing the firmware password, then booting into target disk mode.

Well there is a much simpler way to do this.

> 1. Hold `Option` while computer is booting.
> 2. Enter firmware password when prompted.
> 3. When you see the local hard drive listed hit `T`.
> 4. Congrats, you are now in target disk mode.
