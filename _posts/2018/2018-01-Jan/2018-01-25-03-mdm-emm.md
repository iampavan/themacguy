When Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) was making a dramatic entrance with enterprises a few years ago, Mobile Device Management (MDM) seemed an effective counterbalance to the security concerns posed by the influx of new devices. But just a few short years later, it’s clear that MDM alone isn’t enough to address all the concerns in an enterprise mobility program.
