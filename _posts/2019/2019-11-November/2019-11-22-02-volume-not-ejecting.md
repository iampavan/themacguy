How to fix: The volume can't be ejected because it's currently in use

## At the time of writing this article, I was using :

- macOS Catalina 10.15.1 Build 19B88

## Steps :

1. Launch the `Terminal.app` from the Utilities folder of your Applications folder

2. Next we need to find the proper name of our disk:
```
ls -ll /Volumes/
```

3. Now letâ€™s find out which system process uses our disk. For this we use the `lsof` tool.
```
sudo lsof | grep /Volumes/Samsung\ T5
```

4. Once we know what process is preventing us from ejecting our disk, we can force it to stop. For this we use the `killall` tool.
```
sudo killall mds
```

5. Sometimes you might need to kill the process by its PID.
```
sudo kill -9 88512
```

6. Testing bash code
{% highlight bash %}
sudo lsof | grep /Volumes/Samsung\ T5
{% endhighlight %}
